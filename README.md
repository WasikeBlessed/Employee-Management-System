Welcome to the Employee Management System (EMS), a handy tool to streamline HR tasks for businesses of any size. With EMS, you can manage employee profiles, track attendance, process payroll, handle leave requests, and generate insightful reports—all from one simple interface. To get started, clone the repo with git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-management-system.git, install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt, set up a MySQL database named ems_db (update config.py with your credentials), and run python app.py to launch it at http://localhost:5000. Log in with default admin credentials (admin / admin123) and start exploring! Customize settings like database or port in config.py, and feel free to contribute by forking the repo, creating a branch, and submitting a pull request.
